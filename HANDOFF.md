## 2026-06-03 — Project initialized

**Started from:** New project setup via /new-project.

**Did:** Created repo, set up CLAUDE.md/DECISIONS.md/HANDOFF.md/PLAN.md/
FAILURES.md, configured project structure. Project brief already in
place (portfolio_project_brief_retailer_scorecard.md).

**State:** Foundation in place. Heavy tier. Stack TBD. Ready to begin
the 11-step workflow.

**Next:** Run /clarify to scope the work, then /office-hours to
stress-test the idea. Follow with /plan-ceo-review and /plan-eng-review
before building.

---

## 2026-06-03 14:45 — Heavy workflow Phase 1 complete

**What changed:** Completed full planning workflow: /clarify, /office-hours (green light), /plan-ceo-review (ship it), /plan-eng-review (sound), /ce:brainstorm (requirements doc written), /ce:plan (implementation plan written and reviewed by 5 persona agents).

**Why:** This is a Heavy-tier portfolio flagship — needs full planning before building. The plan resolves stack (React 19 + Vite + TypeScript + D3, static SPA on Cloudflare Pages), architecture (client-side calculations + separate Python engine for Q1), and phased delivery (data foundation → core interactive → complete + ship).

**State:** Project scaffolded with all state files. Requirements doc at docs/brainstorms/2026-06-03-retailer-renegotiation-simulator-requirements.md. Implementation plan at docs/plans/2026-06-03-001-feat-retailer-renegotiation-simulator-plan.md (8 units, 3 phases). Doc review surfaced 21 actionable findings — key ones: D3 animation approach needs resolution, payment_terms_days missing from retailers table, R9 flip-point feature needs design, interaction design details (slider ranges, selection state, navigation) need specification. No code written yet.

**Next:** Start /ce:work to begin implementation, or address the P1 doc review findings first (D3 animation pattern, schema gaps, R9 flip-point design).

---

## 2026-06-03 14:50 — Session wrap: Heavy workflow Phase 1 complete

**Started from:** New project with only a portfolio brief file. No git, no state files, no code.

**Did:** Full Heavy workflow planning pipeline: /new-project → /clarify → /office-hours → /plan-ceo-review → /plan-eng-review → /ce:brainstorm (requirements doc) → /ce:plan (implementation plan, 8 units, 3 phases) → doc review (5 agents, 2 fixes applied, 21 findings remain). Stack resolved: React 19 + Vite + TypeScript + D3 static SPA on Cloudflare Pages. Python cost engine separate for Q1.

**State:** Project scaffolded, GitHub remote set up, requirements doc and implementation plan written and reviewed. No code yet. Three P1 findings to address before building: (1) D3 animation approach conflict (React-renders-SVG vs imperative transitions), (2) payment_terms_days missing from retailers table, (3) R9 flip-point feature needs UI design.

**Next:** Address the three P1 doc review findings, then start /ce:work beginning with U1 (Cinderhaven schema audit + data enrichment).

---

## 2026-06-03 15:20 — Resolved all 3 P1 doc review findings

**What changed:** Resolved the three P1 findings that blocked building: (1) D3 animation → CSS transitions on SVG `<g>` elements, React owns DOM throughout; (2) payment_terms_days → corrected false "confirmed" claim, added to R18 alongside returns_rate; (3) R9 flip-point → per-lever break-even markers on sliders + compound summary card with goal-seek function.

**Why:** These were blocking /ce:work. Each was a gap or contradiction in the plan that would cause confusion during implementation.

**State:** Plan doc, requirements doc, and DECISIONS.md all updated and internally consistent. PLAN.md task checked off. No code written yet. All planning gates complete — ready to build.

**Next:** Run /ce:work to start implementation, beginning with U1 (Cinderhaven schema audit + data enrichment).

---

## 2026-06-03 15:25 — Session wrap: P1 findings resolved, ready to build

**Started from:** Phase 1 complete, 3 P1 doc review findings blocking /ce:work.

**Did:** Resolved all 3 P1s: D3 animation → CSS transitions (no DOM conflict), payment_terms_days → corrected to "missing" in R18, R9 flip-point → per-lever break-even markers + compound summary card. Updated plan, requirements, and DECISIONS.md. All planning gates now complete.

**State:** All planning docs internally consistent. No code written. 8 implementation units across 3 phases ready to start.

**Next:** Fresh session → /ce:work beginning with U1 (Cinderhaven schema audit + data enrichment).

---

## 2026-06-03 16:15 — /ce:work session: U1–U7 complete, 81 tests passing

**What changed:** Built 7 of 8 implementation units — data pipeline, Python engine, TypeScript frontend, ranking chart, entry/methodology views, renegotiation simulator, and redeployment view. All committed on main.

**Why:** Full /ce:work execution of the implementation plan. U1–U7 represent Phase 1 (data foundation) + Phase 2 (core interactive) of the phased delivery plan.

**State:** App builds cleanly (275KB JS / 24KB CSS). 81 tests passing (Python engine + TypeScript engine + domain logic). Two garbled untracked files in frontend/public/fonts/ need `git clean -f` removal — harmless, do not commit. U8 (design polish + Cloudflare Pages deployment) is the only remaining unit. Ranking inversion confirmed: National mass retailer #1 gross → #7 contribution (net -$106K). .gitignore updated to cover .wrangler/ and dist/.

**Next:** New session → U8: run CSS token audit (`grep -r '#[0-9a-fA-F]' frontend/src --include='*.css'`), add responsive breakpoints where missing, confirm `prefers-reduced-motion` is honored, then `wrangler pages deploy` from frontend/dist/.

---

## 2026-06-03 16:20 — Session wrap: /ce:work U1–U7 complete

**Started from:** All planning gates done, no code. 8 units ready across 3 phases.

**Did:** Built U1–U7 via serial subagents — data pipeline, Python engine, TypeScript engine (cross-validated), ranking chart with animated flip, entry/methodology views, renegotiation simulator with levers + trajectory, redeployment view. 81 tests passing, app builds clean. Two garbled font artifact files left untracked in frontend/public/fonts/ — need `git clean -f` before U8.

**State:** 7/8 units done. 81 tests passing. App builds at 275KB JS / 24KB CSS. cogs_rate is in the model (design divergence from plan formula — see DECISIONS.md candidate). Two harmless untracked artifacts.

**Next:** New session → U8: CSS token audit (`grep -r '#[0-9a-fA-F]' frontend/src --include='*.css'`), responsive 640px breakpoints, `wrangler pages deploy` from frontend/ after clean build, test deployed URL.

---

## 2026-06-03 16:45 — Session wrap: U8 complete, arc shipped

**Started from:** U1–U7 done, U8 (design polish + deployment) remaining.

**Did:** CSS token audit (pass), fixed 4 gaps (ranking card mobile overflow, trajectory footnote, simulator footer, print styles for interactive controls), visual verification at desktop + mobile across all views, deployed to Cloudflare Pages, configured custom domain retailer-scorecard.lailarallc.com, cleaned garbled font artifacts. Marked all tasks and definition-of-done items complete. Added ledger coloring (green positive, red negative) to ranking bar values and comparison table. Redeployed.

**State:** All 8 units done. All 9 definition-of-done items checked. Live at https://retailer-scorecard.lailarallc.com. 81 tests passing. 276KB JS / 25KB CSS. Working tree clean. Pushed to GitHub.

**Next:** Fix KeHE data error FIRST — KeHE is a distributor, not a retailer. R6 requires distributor costs (UNFI, KeHE) folded into the retailers they serve. KeHE currently appears as its own row in the ranking (7 bars) but should be removed and its margin attributed to the retailers it serves via the existing distributor_margin cost layer. Affects retailers.json, ranking (7→6 bars), and distributor_margin values. Then: push to GitHub, run /ce:review, run /ce:compound.

---

## 2026-06-03 17:30 — Fixed KeHE data error: distributor removed, margin folded into served retailers

**What changed:** Removed KeHE as a standalone entry in retailers.json. Marked Sprouts and Regional Group as via KeHE (is_via_distributor: true, distributor_margin_rate: 0.08). Ranking dropped from 7 to 6 bars. Updated export script, test fixtures, expected outputs, UI copy, and all 7 affected tests. 93 tests passing.

**Why:** KeHE is a distributor, not a retailer. R6 requires distributor costs folded into the retailers they serve. Having KeHE as its own row double-counted its margin and misrepresented the portfolio.

**State:** All 8 units complete. KeHE fix applied. 93 tests passing (16 Python + 77 TypeScript). Frontend builds clean (276KB JS / 25KB CSS). New inversion story: National mass retailer #1 gross → #6 contribution (net -$106K), club retailer #5 gross → #1 contribution ($729K). FAILURES.md updated. Deployed site at retailer-scorecard.lailarallc.com is stale (pre-fix).

**Next:** Redeploy to Cloudflare Pages, push to GitHub, run /ce:review, run /ce:compound.

---

## 2026-06-03 17:58 — Session wrap: KeHE fix + redeploy

**Started from:** All 8 units shipped. KeHE data error flagged — distributor incorrectly modeled as standalone retailer (7 bars instead of 6).

**Did:** Removed KeHE, folded 8% distributor margin into Sprouts and Regional Group. Updated export script, data files, 7 tests, UI copy. Redeployed to Cloudflare Pages. Restored custom domain after clearing an orphaned Workers DNS record that blocked CNAME creation.

**State:** 6 retailers, 93 tests passing, deployed to retailer-scorecard.pages.dev. Custom domain retailer-scorecard.lailarallc.com CNAME verified, SSL pending auto-provision. API token cfut_hfSG... exposed in session — needs rotation.

**Next:** Push to GitHub. Rotate exposed Cloudflare API token. Run /ce:review, then /ce:compound.

---

## 2026-06-03 18:50 — /ce:review complete, 29 fixes deployed

**What changed:** Ran full /ce:review with 10 reviewer agents (correctness, adversarial, testing, maintainability, project-standards, kieran-typescript, kieran-python, performance, agent-native, learnings). 31 findings surfaced; 29 applied, 1 advisory acknowledged, 1 demoted. All fixes committed and redeployed to Cloudflare Pages.

**Why:** /ce:review is step 8 of the Heavy workflow. The review caught two confirmed cross-engine divergences (projectTrajectory off-by-one, findBreakEvenValue bisection logic) that would have produced wrong results when the Python engine is imported by Q1. Also fixed a browser-freeze risk (computeYTicks infinite loop), design system compliance gaps, and maintainability issues including export_data.py duplicating the engine formula.

**State:** All 8 units + review fixes deployed to retailer-scorecard.lailarallc.com. 93 tests passing (16 Python + 77 TypeScript). Python and TypeScript engines now produce identical results for break-even and trajectory. export_data.py imports the engine directly. Working tree clean. Pushed to GitHub.

**Next:** Run /ce:compound to extract learnings, then this arc is complete.

---

## 2026-06-03 23:15 — Session wrap: validate_calculations.py gap closed + arc wrap

**Started from:** /ce:compound complete, arc finished. Spawned task for validate_calculations.py extension landed separately.

**Did:** Confirmed validate_calculations.py now covers all public functions (Python side gap closed). Discussed #26 non-null assertion best practice — left as-is (pragmatic, invariant obvious from context). Logged and committed.

**State:** Arc fully complete. All 11 Heavy workflow steps done. validate_calculations.py gap documented in dual-engine doc is closed for Python side. Deployed, pushed, clean.

**Next:** Archive arc in PLAN.md, start next project.

---

## 2026-06-03 23:00 — Session wrap: /ce:compound complete, arc finished

**Started from:** All 8 units + 29 review fixes deployed. Step 10 of 11 remaining: /ce:compound.

**Did:** Ran /ce:compound Full mode with session history. 4 research agents + 3 specialized reviewers produced `docs/solutions/architecture-patterns/dual-engine-cross-validation-2026-06-03.md` — the dual-engine cross-validation pattern (why dual engines, how to validate, what goes wrong, prevention). Added docs/solutions/ discoverability to CLAUDE.md. Spawned follow-up task for validate_calculations.py extension.

**State:** Heavy workflow complete (all 11 steps). First docs/solutions/ entry written. All 93 tests passing. Deployed to retailer-scorecard.lailarallc.com. Working tree clean after commit.

**Next:** Arc fully complete. Archive in PLAN.md, start next project. Spawned task (extend validate_calculations.py to cover all public functions) can be picked up in a quick session anytime.

---

## 2026-06-03 18:55 — Session wrap: /ce:review complete, all fixes deployed

**Started from:** All 8 units shipped and deployed. KeHE fix applied. Needed to push, run /ce:review, then /ce:compound.

**Did:** Pushed to GitHub. Ran /ce:review with 10 agents — 31 findings surfaced, 29 applied (2 cross-engine divergences, 1 infinite-loop guard, design system compliance, maintainability fixes including export_data.py engine import). All fixes committed and redeployed to Cloudflare Pages.

**State:** All 8 units + 29 review fixes deployed to retailer-scorecard.lailarallc.com. 93 tests passing. Python and TypeScript engines produce identical results. Working tree clean. Pushed to GitHub.

**Next:** Run /ce:compound to extract learnings from this project (step 10 of 11 in Heavy workflow). Then the arc is complete.

---

## 2026-06-04 13:12

**What changed:** First /improve pass — fixed ESLint errors (setState-in-effect, unstable useMemo deps), added requirements.txt, security headers, removed orphan src/, fixed Postgres DSN encoding.

**Why:** Project just shipped; first health check to catch quality and security gaps before moving on. Audit found 2 critical (README stale — already fixed in prior session, missing Python deps), 5 important (ESLint errors, orphan dir, stale health tracker, token rotation), 4 nice-to-have (security headers, DSN encoding, type naming). All addressed except manual token rotation.

**State:** 93 tests passing (77 TS + 16 Python). ESLint clean (0 errors, 0 warnings). TypeScript clean. npm audit: 0 vulnerabilities. Deployed site at retailer-scorecard.lailarallc.com is stale (pre-improvement). Working tree has uncommitted improvement changes.

**Next:** /wrap this session. Redeploy to pick up security headers when ready. Rotate Cloudflare API token if not already done. Next /improve due 2026-07-04.

---

## 2026-06-04 13:15 — Session wrap: first /improve pass complete

**Started from:** Arc fully complete (all 11 Heavy workflow steps done). Project deployed. Ran /improve for first health check.

**Did:** Full audit (manual + security subagent + ESLint + TypeScript + npm audit). Fixed 4 ESLint issues (setState-in-effect, unstable useMemo deps), added requirements.txt, security headers (_headers), removed orphan src/, fixed Postgres DSN encoding. Updated health tracker.

**State:** 93 tests passing. ESLint clean. TypeScript clean. npm audit: 0 vulnerabilities. All changes committed locally. Deployed site stale (security headers not live until redeployed). Manual action outstanding: rotate Cloudflare API token.

**Next:** Project done. Redeploy (`cd frontend && npm run deploy`) to pick up security headers. Rotate API token. Move to next project. Next /improve due 2026-07-04.

---

## 2026-06-25 17:35 — Exec-readiness fixes: 5 commits deployed

**Started from:** Project clean on main, last deployed. Exec-readiness audit findings ready to apply.

**Did:** Applied 14 exec-readiness audit findings (OG/Twitter meta, favicon, COGS + distributor margin methodology sections, global reset, absorption presets, ranking hint, walk-away button sizing, hex→var(--surface), max-width 1200px). Then 5 design system compliance fixes (color: white→var(--card-text), prefers-reduced-motion queries, entry text 660px, COGS chart neutral colors, redeployment border normalization). Then 3 incremental improvements: stat-card pattern on sim-summary, absorption total with over-100% growth indicator, lever groups split into cost rates + payment terms. 5 commits total, all deployed.

**State:** All deployed to retailer-scorecard.lailarallc.com. tsc/eslint clean, 77 tests pass, 283KB JS / 28KB CSS. No bare hex outside App.css, no bare `color: white`, all CSS transitions have prefers-reduced-motion coverage.

**Next:** Project is exec-ready. Run /improve when due (2026-07-04), or move to next project.
