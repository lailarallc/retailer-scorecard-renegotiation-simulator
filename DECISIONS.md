# Retailer Scorecard & Renegotiation Simulator — Decisions Log

Permanent record of choices that should survive session turnover.
If a decision is reversed, strike it through and add the replacement
below — don't delete.

## Format

Each entry:
- **Date** — when decided
- **Decision** — one sentence, imperative voice
- **Why** — the reasoning, including what was tried and rejected
- **Scope** — what this applies to (file, chunk, deliverable, or "global")
- **Do not** — explicit anti-instructions, if any

## Architecture & Pipeline

### 2026-06-03 — Use Heavy tier (full 11-step workflow)
- **Why:** High-value portfolio piece with downstream dependencies
  (Question Engine Q1), complex interactive requirements, and
  long-term maintenance expectations.
- **Scope:** global
- **Do not:** Skip gstack gates (/office-hours, /plan-ceo-review,
  /plan-eng-review)

### 2026-06-03 — Static SPA on Cloudflare Pages, not FastAPI on Fly.io
- **Why:** Every Lailara portfolio piece is a static SPA with
  pre-computed JSON. Client-side TypeScript calculations give
  zero-latency slider response. Fly.io is reserved for full-stack
  apps (Competitive Shelf Intelligence). The brief's FastAPI
  assumption was overturned by portfolio-wide pattern research.
- **Scope:** global — deployment, architecture, data flow
- **Do not:** Add a FastAPI backend or live database connection.
  All data is pre-computed via Python scripts to static JSON.

### 2026-06-03 — React 19 + Vite + TypeScript + D3 stack
- **Why:** Matches retailer-deduction-recovery (the most complex
  interactive piece in the portfolio). React manages state across
  panels; D3 handles animated chart transitions. Observable Plot
  rejected because the simulator's slider-driven real-time
  recalculation needs D3's imperative update model. Recharts
  rejected because it lacks transition control for animated
  ranking reordering.
- **Scope:** global — frontend framework and charting library
- **Do not:** Use Observable Plot, Recharts, or vanilla JS without
  a framework. Do not add Redux or context providers — useState +
  useMemo is sufficient (matches portfolio pattern).

### 2026-06-03 — Dual calculation implementation: Python + TypeScript
- **Why:** The Python cost engine must be importable by Q1 (R14).
  The frontend must recalculate instantly on slider drag (no API
  round-trips). Both requirements are non-negotiable — so the cost
  model formulas exist in both languages, validated against each
  other via shared test fixtures. Maintenance cost accepted for
  zero-latency interaction.
- **Scope:** engine/ (Python) and frontend/src/calculations.ts
  (TypeScript)
- **Do not:** Let the implementations drift — run cross-validation
  before every deploy. Every formula change must be made in both
  languages and verified against shared fixtures.

### 2026-06-03 — CSS transitions for ranking animation, not D3 imperative transitions
- **Why:** The plan specified both "React-renders-SVG" (React owns DOM)
  and "use d3-transition" (D3 mutates DOM) — these conflict. CSS
  transitions resolve it cleanly: React re-renders SVG `<g>` elements
  with new y-positions from D3 scales, and `transition: transform 200ms
  ease-out` handles the smooth interpolation. React owns the DOM
  throughout. `prefers-reduced-motion` handled via `@media` query.
- **Scope:** `frontend/src/ranking/` — RankingView and rankingDomain
- **Do not:** Use `d3-transition` for the ranking animation. D3 is
  math-only (scales, positions). If CSS transitions prove insufficient
  for complex staggered effects, escalate — do not silently switch to
  imperative D3.

### 2026-06-03 — R9 flip-point UI: per-lever break-even markers + compound summary card
- **Why:** R9 ("see the levers that would flip a retailer to positive")
  was under-specified with no UI design. Resolved as: each slider shows
  a tick mark at the break-even value for that lever alone (holding
  others constant). Below the levers, a summary card shows the minimum
  compound path to break-even weighted by negotiability. Goal-seek
  function in calculations.ts.
- **Scope:** `frontend/src/simulator/` — SimulatorView levers and
  simulatorDomain break-even logic
- **Do not:** Auto-move sliders to break-even values. The markers show
  where break-even is; the visitor decides whether to go there.

## Data & Schema

### 2026-06-03 — payment_terms_days must be added to Cinderhaven schema
- **Why:** The requirements doc incorrectly claimed "confirmed" for
  payment_terms_days on the retailers table. Doc review found it is
  missing. Required for the working-capital drag formula:
  `terms × daily_revenue × cost_of_capital`. Added to R18 alongside
  returns_rate.
- **Scope:** Cinderhaven platform schema, U1 data audit, R18
- **Do not:** Assume payment_terms_days exists — it must be created
  during the U1 schema audit alongside returns_rate.

### 2026-06-03 — Include cogs_rate in True Contribution formula
- **Why:** The plan formula (`True Contribution = Gross Revenue - [six layers]`)
  cannot produce a net-negative result — cost layers are percentages of revenue
  and cannot sum to > 100%. The brief explicitly states the anchor retailer
  "runs at negative true contribution." Including `cogs_rate` resolves this:
  `gross_margin = gross_revenue × (1 - cogs_rate)`, then
  `true_contribution = gross_margin - total_cost_layers`. The national mass retailer at 55% COGS
  + 28% trade spend + 8.2% deductions produces -$106K. Both the Python engine
  and TypeScript engine implement this formula, cross-validated via shared
  fixtures.
- **Scope:** engine/cost_model.py, frontend/src/calculations.ts, all tests
  and fixtures, retailers.json (cogs_rate field on every retailer)
- **Do not:** Remove cogs_rate from the formula or the JSON schema. Do not
  revert to the plan's simplified formula — it cannot produce the inversion
  story the project is built around.

## Visualization

### 2026-06-03 — Use Lailara Design System v2 for all visual design
- **Why:** Consistent brand across portfolio pieces. The design system
  (defined in parent CLAUDE.md) prescribes colors, typography, chart
  rules, and interaction patterns. Specifically: HK teal sequential
  palette for magnitude-ranked retailer data, Chicago navy for
  interactive elements, Canvas background, Playfair Display headings,
  Source Sans 3 body, click-to-pin interactions, 200ms ease-out
  transitions, Economist-style chart rules.
- **Scope:** global — all UI, charts, and interactive elements
- **Do not:** Use arbitrary colors, Google Fonts CDN, hover tooltips,
  gradients, 3D effects, or rounded corners beyond 2px border-radius

### 2026-06-03 — Ledger coloring for all monetary values
- **Why:** Real ledger convention — positive amounts in green (HK-25),
  negative in red (Tokyo-40). Makes sign immediately visible without
  reading the minus sign. Applies to ranking values, comparison tables,
  dark card breakdowns, contribution summaries, and net impact callouts.
  Utility classes `val-pos` / `val-neg` in App.css for reuse.
- **Scope:** global — all components that display dollar amounts
- **Do not:** Color non-monetary numbers (retailer counts, percentages
  that are input parameters like lever rates). Only apply to
  dollar-denominated results.

### 2026-06-03 — Distributors (KeHE, UNFI) are never standalone ranking entries
- **Why:** R6 requires distributor costs folded into the retailer they
  serve. A CEO thinks in terms of retail relationships, not distributor
  relationships. Showing KeHE as its own bar double-counted margin and
  inflated the retailer count.
- **Scope:** retailers.json schema, ranking chart, any future retailer
  additions
- **Do not:** Add a distributor as a top-level entry in retailers.json.
  Instead, set `is_via_distributor: true`, `distributor_name`, and
  `distributor_margin_rate` on the retailers that distributor serves.

### 2026-06-03 — TS findBreakEvenValue must use symmetric sign-change detection matching Python
- **Why:** The original TS guard `if (atMin >= 0 || atMax >= 0)` returned null
  for valid sign-change cases Python would correctly bisect (atMax > 0, atMin < 0).
  Caught by /ce:review — correctness and adversarial reviewers both flagged it
  independently. The TS bisection now uses the same symmetric test:
  `if (atMin >= 0 && atMax >= 0) return min; if (atMin < 0 && atMax < 0) return null;`
  and determines bisection direction by comparing signs of `evalAt(lo)` and `evalAt(mid)`.
- **Scope:** `frontend/src/calculations.ts` findBreakEvenValue function
- **Do not:** Change the bisection logic in one engine without updating
  the other. Any future break-even changes must land in both Python and
  TypeScript simultaneously with cross-engine test coverage.

### 2026-06-03 — export_data.py must import engine, not reimplement formulas
- **Why:** The export script had a standalone compute_contributions() that
  reimplemented all 8 cost layers. Fixtures were generated by this duplicate,
  not the canonical engine — so formula drift between the two was invisible
  to tests. Refactored to import engine.calculate_contributions via
  RetailerInput.from_dict(). The fixture pipeline is now self-consistent
  with the engine by construction.
- **Scope:** `scripts/export_data.py`, fixture generation
- **Do not:** Add standalone cost calculations in any script. All cost math
  flows through `engine/cost_model.py`. Scripts build RetailerInput objects
  and call the engine.
